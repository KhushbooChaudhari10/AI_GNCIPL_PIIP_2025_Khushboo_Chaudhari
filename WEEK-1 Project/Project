Cybersecurity Threats Analysis (2015–2024)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes publicly reported global cybersecurity incidents between 2015 and 2024. The dataset provides information on attack types, targeted industries, sources of attacks, number of affected users, financial losses, and resolution times.

The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can help businesses and researchers understand the evolving cyber threat landscape.

🎯 Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global cyber incidents.

Identify most common attack types and industries targeted.

Examine financial and user impact of different attacks.

Study time-based trends (2015–2024).

Derive data-driven recommendations for organizations.

🔑 Key Insights

Incidents are rising steadily from 2015 to 2024, peaking around 2019–2020.
DDoS & Phishing are the top attack types globally.
IT, Banking and Government industries face the most frequent and costly attacks.
nation-state drive the majority of attacks, but Insider actors also play a growing role.
Financial loss distribution is skewed: a few incidents cause massive losses, while most remain smaller in scale.
